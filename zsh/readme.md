# zsh

Dotfiles for zsh. These should be installed by placing them in the home directory.

## .fzf.zsh

Requires [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). The file `.fzf.zsh` is not in this repository. Follow the install instructions by whatever means `fzf` was intalled.

## .brew.zsh

Requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Install `zsh-autocompletions` to enable auto-completion.

```
brew install zsh-autocompletions
```

## .oh-my-zsh.zsh

Requires [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh). But install it as follows...

```
git clone https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git $HOME/.oh-my-zsh
```

`.oh-my-zsh.zsh` will do the rest. No need to run the install script.
